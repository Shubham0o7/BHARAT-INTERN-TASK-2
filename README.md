# Titanic Survival Classification System 

## Project Overview:

This project explores the prediction of passenger survival on the RMS Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features such as age, gender, class, and ticket information, which can be used to build a model that predicts the likelihood of a passenger surviving the tragic event.

## Project Features:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, convert categorical features to numerical representations, and engineer new features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize data distributions, identify correlations between features, and gain insights into passenger demographics and survival patterns.
* **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train and evaluate various machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
* **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Select the best-performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or cross-validation.

## Technologies:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Functioning:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Load the Titanic dataset and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features to improve model performance.
3. **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing data using appropriate metrics.
6. **Model Selection and Tuning:** Select the best-performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters.
7. **Prediction and Analysis:** Make predictions on the test data and analyze the results.
